        <p>These pumpkin brownies are perfect for fall! Two tasty batters — a decadent chocolate and a pumpkin-nut with fall spices — are swirled together in this fun twist on a classic brownie recipe. Serve them warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for tonight's dessert or wrap one up for tomorrow's lunch.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>                
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>                
            <li>¾ cup butter, melted</li>                
            <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>                
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>                
            <li>3 large eggs</li>                
            <li>½ cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>                
            <li>¼ cup cocoa powder</li>                
            <li>½ cup pumpkin puree</li>                
            <li>½ cup chopped walnuts</li>                
            <li>¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>                
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cloves</li>                
            <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the batter base: Stir the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Stir sugar, melted butter, and vanilla together in a large bowl. Add eggs one at a time. Gradually add flour mixture and stir until the batter is smooth.</li>
            <li>Separate the batters: Pour half of the batter into the medium bowl. Stir chocolate chips and cocoa into one bowl of batter. Stir pumpkin puree, walnuts, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg into the second bowl.</li>
            <li>Layer and swirl the batters: Spread half of the chocolate batter into the bottom of a prepared baking pan. Spread half of the pumpkin batter on top. Repeat the layers with the remaining batters. Drag a knife or small spatula through the layers in a swirling motion.</li>
            <li>Bake the brownies: Bake the brownies in a preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Allow the brownies to cool completely before cutting them into 16 even squares.</li>
        </ol>
